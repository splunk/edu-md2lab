# Splunk Cloud Administration

## Summary

This course is for administrators new to Splunk Cloud and those wanting to become more experienced in managing Splunk Cloud instances.

The course provides administrators with the opportunity to gain the skills, knowledge and best practices for data management and system configuration for data collection and ingestion required in a Splunk Cloud environment to create a productive Splunk SaaS deployment. The hands-on labs provide the opportunity to learn and ask questions on how to manage and maintain the platform, the users and how to effectively get data into Splunk Cloud. Modules include data inputs and forwarder configuration, data management, user accounts, and basic monitoring and problem isolation.

Note: Splunk Cloud Administration and Transitioning to Splunk Cloud SHOULD NOT be taken together as both are designed to develop Splunk Cloud-specific skills and as such there is some overlap.
